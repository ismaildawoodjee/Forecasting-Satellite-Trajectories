# Forecasting-Satellite-Trajectories-IDAO-2020
 This repository contains details about my approach to forecasting satellite trajectories
for Part A of the International Data Analytics Olympiad 2020 in January-February 2020.

I also used a subset of the dataset (the x-coordinate of Satellite 372) for my Applied
Machine Learning module, achieving 47/60 distinction score and good feedback from my instructor
(the 47/100 was due to a system error on the university Moodle website).
