# Forecasting-Satellite-Trajectories-IDAO-2020
 This repository contains details about my approach to forecasting satellite trajectories
for Part A of the International Data Analytics Olympiad 2020 in January-February 2020. 
It also includes an assignment I did for my Applied Machine Learning module, in which I
used non-linear regression to model one satellite's x-coordinate in R.
